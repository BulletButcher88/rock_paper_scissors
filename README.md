# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME
### work in progress

Learning javascript is a lot of fun when it comes to interacting with a user.

Room for improvement :
Both players are selecting from a random number 1-3, I plan to make three button selection for payers to pick rock, paper, or scissors, process the score.
